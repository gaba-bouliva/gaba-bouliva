# 👋 Hi, I'm Gaba Bouliva

I'm a Software Developer based in Italy with 5+ years of experience building scalable, cloud-native applications using Go and Vue.js. I specialize in backend development with Go (Gin/Fiber) and frontend development with Vue.js, coupled with experience deploying and maintaining applications in cloud environments (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes).

I love solving real-world problems through clean, efficient code and collaborating with teams to ship high-quality software.

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I enjoy writing Go code more than any other language — but I’ve worked with JavaScript, Python, and PHP too. Also, I’m always on the hunt for the next cool project to learn from.
